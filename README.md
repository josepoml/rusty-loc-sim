## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or later
- iTunes or Apple Mobile Device Support installed
- iOS device (recent version)

### Download

Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/rusty-loc-sim/releases) page.

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rusty-loc-sim.git
cd rusty-loc-sim

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# The binary will be available at target/release/rusty-loc-sim.exe
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

**IMPORTANT:** For the program to work, you need to download `wintun.dll`. You can get it from the official website [here](https://www.wintun.net/). And place it in the same directory as the executable.

Run the executable as administrator. If you cloned the repo, run `cargo run` from an administrator terminal. This is required because `wintun.dll` needs admin privileges to access the network hardware.

If you haven't enabled developer mode on your device, you can do it as follows:

```bash
reveal-developer-mode
```

Now, go to your device settings and search for developer mode. Enable it:

You can't connect to the device without enabling developer mode.

#### Connect your device via USB and run `connect` to establish a connection:

```bash
connect
```

#### Now, if no errors occurred, you are ready to start simulating:

```bash
simulate-location --lat 40.7128 --lng -74.0060
```

To reset the location, simply reboot your device.
